Bitcoin Core - Full Regtest Halving Schedule
=====================================

This repo generates Bitcoin distributables with a modified regtest halving schedule to match that of a mainnet or testnet node.

When running a Bitcoin regtest node using one of these distributables, the halving schedule will be `210000` blocks similar to mainnet/testnet, as opposed to the standard `150` blocks for a regtest network.

Built distributables can be found on the [Releases page](https://github.com/hirosystems/bitcoin/releases), and on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hirosystems/bitcoin).
